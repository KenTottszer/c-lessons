3. The day of the year

Write a program that asks the user to enter a date (year, month, day), and prints which day it is in the given year (from 1 to 365 or to 366). Reading the year, too, is necessary, since the leap years also have to be taken into account. Every fourth year is a leap year, but every one hundredth is not, but every 400th still is. Year 2000 was a leap year.
