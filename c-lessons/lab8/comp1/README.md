Dynamic arrays: Sum and average
Create a C program that calculates the sum and average of elements in a dynamic integer array, the calculation should be in one separate function. The size and the elements of the array read from the user


Hint: 
Define a function calculateSumAndAverage that takes a pointer to the dynamic array, the size of the array, and two integer pointers to store the sum and average.

In the main function, ask the user to input the size of the array.

Allocate memory for the dynamic array based on the user input.

Ask the user to input the elements of the dynamic array.

Call the calculateSumAndAverage function, passing the dynamic array, size, and two integer pointers to store the sum and average.

Print the elements of the dynamic array, the sum, and the average.
