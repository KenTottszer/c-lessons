Dynamic arrays: Sorting
Create a C program that sorts a dynamic integer array in ascending order using pointers and a separate function.


Hint: 
Define a function sortArray that takes a pointer to the dynamic array and the size of the array as arguments.

The function should sort the elements of the array in ascending order using any sorting algorithm of your choice (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, etc.).

In the main function, ask the user to input the size of the array.

Allocate memory for the dynamic array based on the user input.

Ask the user to input the elements of the dynamic array.

Call the sortArray function, passing the dynamic array and the size.

Print the sorted elements of the dynamic array.
