Dynamic arrays: Dynamically growing array

Crate a C program, that can read as many real number from the user as it is needed. Add a new element should be in a separate function. Do not use realloc()!
print the result!

Hint: 
When you add new element, you need to make the array one bigger. 

For that you need to allocate, copy, add the new element. 

The old pointer must be earesed as soon as possible!!
