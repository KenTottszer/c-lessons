Pointers: Pointer Swap
Create a C program that swaps the values of two integer variables using pointers.

Before Swap:
a = 5
b = 10
After Swap:
a = 10
b = 5

Hint: Define two integer variables, a and b, and initialize them with some values.
Define two pointers, ptrA and ptrB, to point to the addresses of a and b, respectively.
Use pointers to swap the values of a and b without using a temporary variable.
Print the values of a and b before and after the swap.
