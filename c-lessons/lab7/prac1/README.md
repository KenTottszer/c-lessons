The C programming language does not have built-in support for rational numbers. Let us add this feature! Declare a type to store rational numbers (numerator, denominator) and write functions

to print a rational number
to read a rational number from the input
to add, and to multiply two rational numbers
to convert a rational number to a real (double) number
