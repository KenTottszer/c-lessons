The natural number can e=2.7182818â€¦ can be obtained by the following infinite sum:

e = 1/0! + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! ......

Write a program to compute it with the first 20 terms! Note that the factorial can be a high number, use a double data type to store it!

Hint: if you have used nested loops, try to simplify your solution! A single loop is enough to solve the problem.
