John Wallis, British mathematician developed the following expression to compute the constant π:

π/2 =  (2*2/1*3) *  (4*4/3*5)  * (6*6/5*7)  * (8*8/7*9) ...

Identify the repeating pattern in the formula, and write a program to evaluate it up to the first n factors (n is obtained from the user). Test the program with n=10, n=100 and n=1000 settings!
