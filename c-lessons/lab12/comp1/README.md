Recursion: factorial
Create a C program to calculate factorial with recursion!
Hint: We call recursive function when the function calles itself. What we need is to think over, when we want to finish the process. 
E.g. we know that n!=n*(n-1)!, but that cannot go forever, so we have to define a base:0!=1 and 1!=1.
