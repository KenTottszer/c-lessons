Write a program that contains an array of 10 elements initialized by values of your choice.

Shift all elements in the array towards the beginning of the array by one cell. The first element should go into the last cell (you may call this process rotation ). Repeat the shifting (rotation) process 10 times, printing the array after each step. Your output should be similar to the one shown on the right side.

Keep in mind, that the task is not to obtain the output by using tricky indexing! The elements of the array must actually move around!

Hint:
There is no need for a second array! The second element can overwrite the first, the third can overwite the secondâ€¦ The only qestion is what shall we put into the last cell. Make a drawing and find out the necessary steps.
