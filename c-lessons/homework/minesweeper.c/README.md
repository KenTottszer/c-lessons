MINESWEEPER
    The field is rectangular, built of square cells. At the beginning mines are placed randomly in a number of the cells, all cell contents are hidden. Stepping on (selecting) a cell will reveal its content: if there is a mine we would explode, the game terminates. If the revealed cell is empty it will show a number: the number of mines in the surrounding 8 cells. The goal is to reveal all cells. Write a minesweeper program with the following features:

        user defined size of the field,
        user defined number of mines,
        measuring the time elapsed,
        marking cells by the player where a mine is suspected,
        automatic revealing of mine-free regions.
