Find all integer numbers (n) between 1 and 1000 that are prime, and the next integer (n+1) has exactly 14 divisors (including 1 and the number itself). Design your program using "wishful thinking". Realize the required functions.

MINIMUM: Realize the function that returns a truth value whether the parameter is a prime or not.

Realize the function that returns the number of divisors of its parameter.

Complete the program.
