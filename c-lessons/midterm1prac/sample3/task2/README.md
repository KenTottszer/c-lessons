Task 2: Write a program, which gives back the statistics of the result of this
midterm (40 points maximum):

Your task is to write a program, which continuously reads the points terminated by any invalid
number (e.g.:41). After the termination, the program prints out minimum, maximum points
and the average of points. Note: The number of students is arbitrary.
Example:
IN: 16,25,40,40
OUT: MIN: 16, MAX:40, AVG:30.25
