Task 2: Write a program, which gives back the statistics of the result of this
midterm:

The mark boundaries of this midterm are 16-22-28-34 for marks 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.
Your task is to write a program, which continuously reads the points terminated by any
negative number (e.g.:-1). After the termination, the program prints out the number of
students who received 1,2,3,4 and 5 marks! Note: The number of students is arbitrary.

Example:
IN: 16 25 40 40
OUT: 1:0 2:1 3:1 4:0 5:2
